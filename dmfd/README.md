# DMfD cloth manipulation data

In this task, the robot folds a square cloth along the diagonal. The cloth is loose on the table (unpinned). This corresponds to the ClothFold Diagonal Unpinned task.

Note that we didnâ€™t have a train/val split during training, since we used this data for RL where we generated data for eval as needed. But I have created 80/20 train and val split here.
